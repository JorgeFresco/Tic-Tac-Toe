# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A tic-tac-toe game made fully with **React**+**Typescript**.

I made it following the tutorial on <a href=https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe>tic-tac-toe react tutorial</a>.
After completing it, I converted it into **Typescript**, added some extras and made some tweaks to the style.

You can try the game on <a href=https://jorgefresco.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe>Tic Tac Toe</a>

Features:
- Besides the normal features, it is possible to "travel in time" to any move that has been played,
  by clicking on the buttons on the right, and even make a different move.
